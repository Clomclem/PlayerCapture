# PlayerCapture

A Fabric mod which allows you to capture players after they die.

:warning: **This mod is server-only!**

## Features (Most aren't implemented yet)

When a player dies, he will switch to spectator mode and along with dropping his items he'll drop a head with his name and texture,
which when placed will respawn him normally.

If the head is destroyed or removed in any way, the player will respawn.

The head (in its dropped form) despawns after 5 minutes unless it is picked up.

## Purpose

This mod is mainly made with the intent that players will able to trap other players,
offering many roleplay opportunities.
